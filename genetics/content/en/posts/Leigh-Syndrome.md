## What is Leigh Syndrome? {#what-is-leigh-syndrome}

Leigh Syndrome, also known as subacute necrotizing encephalopathy, is a rare and progressive genetic disorder that affects the central nervous system, specifically the brainstem and basal ganglia. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that disrupt the normal functioning of cells, particularly those involved in energy production.(Rahman & Poulton, 2009)

## Who is affected by Leigh Syndrome? {#who-is-affected-by-leigh-syndrome}

Leigh Syndrome can affect individuals of any age and gender, but it is most commonly diagnosed in infants and young children.


## What are the symptoms of Leigh Syndrome? {#what-are-the-symptoms-of-leigh-syndrome}

The symptoms of Leigh Syndrome can vary widely from person to person, but they typically include poor appetite, vomiting, seizures, muscle weakness, and problems with movement and breathing. Other symptoms may include vision and hearing loss, heart problems, and developmental delays.


## How is Leigh Syndrome diagnosed? {#how-is-leigh-syndrome-diagnosed}

Diagnosis of Leigh Syndrome usually involves a combination of clinical evaluation, imaging tests such as MRI scans, and genetic testing to identify the mutations responsible for the disease. Other laboratory tests may also be performed to rule out other conditions with similar symptoms (Leigh Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).


## How is Leigh Syndrome managed or treated? {#how-is-leigh-syndrome-managed-or-treated}

At present, there is no cure for Leigh Syndrome, and treatment is focused on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include medications to control seizures, breathing support, and physical therapy. In some cases, dietary changes may also be recommended to help support energy production in the body (Leigh Syndrome Foundation, n.d.).


## How is Leigh Syndrome's Happen ? {#how-is-leigh-syndrome-s-happen}

Leigh syndrome can have different inheritance patterns. It is most commonly inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene (i.e., both parents) in each cell have mutations. This pattern of inheritance applies to most of the Leigh syndrome-associated genes contained in nuclear DNA, including SURF1 and the Mitrochondrian m-Dna.(Wiki, 2023) The parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but they typically do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.()
Therefore Leigh's Syndrome is caused by chromosomal abnormalities and not disjunction events.
And as such, In the F1 generation the probability of having the syndrome is 25% but the probability of carrying the gene is 75%.

## Current Research {#current-research}
Succinic acid has been studied, and shown effective for both Leigh syndrome, and MELAS syndrome. 
A high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet may be followed if a gene on the X chromosome is implicated in an individual's Leigh syndrome. Thiamine (vitamin B1) may be given if pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is known or suspected.
The symptoms of lactic acidosis are treated by supplementing the diet with sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or sodium citrate, but these substances do not treat the cause of Leigh syndrome. Dichloroacetate may also be effective in treating Leigh syndrome-associated lactic acidosis; research is ongoing on this substance.
Coenzyme Q10 supplements have been seen to improve symptoms in some cases.
Another study currently going on is testing the affects of EPI-743 at a dose of 15 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) up to a total 200 mg 3 times daily (TID) orally with meal or by using nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy feeding tubes with liquid food for at least 36 months. Which is expected to be complete by May 31 2023.
## Social and Ethical implications for Current research {#Social-and-Ethical-implications-for-Current-research}
Most of the Current going on Research is Medicinal research over a long period of time. Therefore, All the subjects' families have consented to the research studies and as such there are not major social or ethical implications to this research.
## Interesting Information {#Intersting-Information}
In 2016 a research paper published in the Fertility and Sterility Journal, stated that A healthy child had been born to a women with Leigh Syndrome and a subsequent article posted to cbs titled “A gentical modified baby born to 2 women” reported on the same. In this experiment A women who carried the Leigh syndrome gene went through a SCNT(Stomatic Cell Nuclear Transfer) procedure in which, her Nuclear DNA was put into the female gamete of another women from which the nucleus had been previously removed such that they were able toe curcumevent the M-dna (Zang & Liu, 2016) which contained the genes for Leigh Syndrome as stated previously. And as such a Heathy Baby was able to to be born. (CBC, 2016)
